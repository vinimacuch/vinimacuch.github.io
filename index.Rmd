I'm a doctoral researcher in the [Cognitive Modeling group at the Institute of Cognitive Science](https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/research_groups/cognitive_modeling/home.html), Osnabr√ºck University, where I work on linguistic pragmatics drawing on a range of experimental methods as well as on cognitive modeling. In my PhD, I'm investigating the extent to which pragmatic language processing and production might be construed as probabilistic processes, i.e. as forms of Bayesian inferencing.

I'm broadly interested in the interplay between language, cognition, and interaction. More specifically, I'm interested in how pressures from both invididual cognition and interactive communication shape the usage and organization of language, e.g. how do different linguistic and contextual cues modulate people's discourse expectations and in turn affect their online processing of language and their ascription of intentions, or e.g. how do interactional aspects of human communication such as repair and turn-taking affect the emergence and evolution of language itself.

Additionally, I'm interested in [multi]modality and non-verbal communicative behavior, as well as in issues related to research design and methodology, data analysis, and statistical modeling.
